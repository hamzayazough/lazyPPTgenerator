# Lazy PPT Generator

This project automatically captures slides from a Zoom presentation, performs OCR to detect slide numbers, and compiles the captured images into a PowerPoint file. It allows you to select two screen regions:

1. The region containing the slide number.
2. The region to capture for each slide.

Once the script detects a new slide number, it takes a screenshot of the specified region and adds it to a new PowerPoint slide. Finally, it saves the presentation to your **Downloads** folder.

## Features

- **Interactive Region Selection**: Select the on-screen area where the slide number appears and the area to capture for each slide.
- **OCR Integration**: Uses Tesseract OCR via pytesseract to detect the slide number and avoid duplicates
- **Automated PowerPoint Creation**: Inserts each captured slide into a new PowerPoint file and saves it in your Downloads folder.
- **Manual Exit**: Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the capture loop whenever you want, or exit automatically when Zoom is no longer running.
